### General
***
After running the emulation-src type, currently you must still perform the following as of 20150427:

1. Add "Retroarch-Src" as a "non-Steam" game using the "+" icon on the Libary section of SteamOS
2. Configure your joypad via Retroarch > Settings > Input Settings (use bind all to configure all buttons at once)
3. Transfer any ROMs you had on your system, into appropriate folder structures under `/home/steam/ROMs`

***
### Input (General)
***
Please take note of the following general modifications

* Save state: Left-thumbstick click (L3)
* Load state: Right-thumbstick click (R3)
* Show Retroarch menue: back/select
* Exit Game: Enter menu, choose "Quit Retroarch"
 
Please note: The center button of either the Sony or Microsoft controllers is not ideal for opening the Retroarch menu or quitting Retroarch. Steam Big Picture Mode / SteamOS uses this button by default to bring up the Steam overlay.
