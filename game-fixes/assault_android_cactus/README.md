# How to install
If you're still having trouble getting past the story screen, you can try this save game file:

This save game has the tutorial completed, so it won't show you the opening story screen anymore. 
You can still play the tutorial again from the level select screen.

Install it into ~/.steam/steam/userdata<yoursteamusernumber>/250110/remote/
replace <yoursteamusernumber> with your unique steam user number. If you don't know it, 
just browse to the 'userdata' directory, if it's a single user install of Steam, it will 
be the only sub-directory there.

Replacing your existing 'game0a.sav' with this will wipe any progress and unlocks 
you've made in the game, so only use this if you can't get into the tutorial.
