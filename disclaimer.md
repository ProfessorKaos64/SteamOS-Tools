### Warning!
Usage of this script is at your own risk! If you are at all concerned about the safety of your SteamOS installation, please have a recent or base root partition backup ready! This is typically captured when SteamOS is first installed. If you wish to update it, and feel ok doing so, please do so now.

If any of this is foreign, or greek to you, it may be best to not proceed. However, a proper root backup should be fine if you do harm to your system. Please be advised that the root partition recovery will not touch the `/home` user partition. Any files contained within `/home` will be preserved. 

I will not be responsible for damage done to your SteamOS installation. Please heed these warnings very well.
