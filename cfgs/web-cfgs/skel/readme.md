# Banner image searching
In a Google Image search, click the "Search Tools" tab and set the search size to 
exactly 460x215. This is the standard size for Steam images and you will be able 
to search for specific grid images much easier.

# Default user config folder

The folder "Default" is fairly standard. The only option changed from a default set of options, is
the option to keep Chrome open when it is killed/stopped. Since the only way for now to close
Chrome is to hit the Guide/Center button on the controller and quit (CTRL+W for keyboards), we 
have to uncheck this option to avoid the "Chrome shutdown unexpectedly" message.
